# Vortex Pipelines

This section will describe how to easily run each of Vortex pipeline in details. For complete pipelines flow please see [Vortex overview section](../index.md#overview)

---

## Training Pipeline

This pipeline purpose is to train a deep learning model using the provided dataset. If you need to integrate the training into your own script you can see the [training pipeline API section](../api/vortex.core.pipelines.md#trainingpipeline).

To run this pipeline, make sure you've already prepared:

- **Dataset** : see [this section](../modules/builtin_dataset.md) for built-in datasets, or [this section](dataset_integration.md) for external datasets.
- **Experiment file** : see [this section](experiment_file_config.md) to create one.

The **minimum configuration** required in the experiment file to run training pipeline:
- `experiment_name`
- `model`
- `trainer`
- `device`
- `dataset`
- `dataloader`

If you also want to include validation in the training, you need to specify `validator` configuration, otherwise validation will be skipped in the training.

Additionally, if you want to **resume previous training** or **load pretrained model**, you also need **Vortex model's file** `*.pth`  obtained from previously executed training pipeline which corresponds to the previous mentioned experiment file. Specific checkpoint file on several epoch can be found under **run directory** ( see outputs of this training pipeline section ). This file must be configured in experiment file under [`checkpoint`](experiment_file_config.md#checkpoint) section.


You only need to run this command from the command line interface :

```console
usage: vortex train [-h] -c CONFIG [--resume] [--no-log]

Vortex training pipeline; will generate a Pytorch model file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        path to experiment config file
  --resume              vortex-saved model path for resume training
  --no-log              disable logging, ignore experiment file config
```

E.g. :

```console
vortex train -c experiments/config/efficientnet_b0_classification_cifar10.yml
```

This pipeline will generate several outputs :

- **Local runs log file** : every time a user runs a VORTEX training experiment, the experiment logger module will write a local file `experiments/local_runs.log` which will record all experimental training runs which have already executed sequentially for easier tracking. Example of the content inside `experiments/local_runs.log` is shown below :

        ###############################################################################
        Timestamp : 03/27/2020, 09:24:00
        Experiment Name : test_torchvision_dataset
        Output Path : experiments/outputs/test_torchvision_dataset/601f45782a884286be310b1ffe562597
        Logging Provider : comet_ml
        Experiment Log URL : https://www.comet.ml/hyperion-rg/vortex-dev/601f45782a884286be310b1ffe562597
        ###############################################################################

- **Experiment directory** : If not exist yet, training script will make a directory under the configured `output_directory` path. The created directory will be named after the `experiment_name` configuration and will be the directory to dump training (final weight), validation result (if any), backup, etc.

- **Run directory** : Everytime user runs the training script, it will be tagged as a new experiment run. Vortex (or third party logger) will generate a unique key which will be an identifier for that specific experiment run. And thus, Vortex will make a new directory under the experiment directory which will act as a backup directory. It will store the duplicate of the executed experiment file (as a backup) and will be the directory which store intermediate model’s weight path (weight that saved every n-epoch). For example, in the previous example log the output path is :

        Output Path : experiments/outputs/test_torchvision_dataset/601f45782a884286be310b1ffe562597
    
    The experiment directory is `test_torchvision_dataset` and the run directory is `601f45782a884286be310b1ffe562597`

- **Backup experiment file** : Experiment file will be duplicated and stored under **run directory**
- **Intermediate model file** : File containing model’s weight and training checkpoint will be dumped into **run directory** every *n*-epoch which is configured in `save_epoch` in experiment file with `.pth` extension
- **Final model file** : File containing model's weight and training checkpoint after all training epoch is completed will be dumped in the **experiment directory** with `.pth` extension
- **Experiment log** : If logging is enabled, training metrics will be collected by the logging provider. Additionally if the config file is valid for validation, the validation metrics will also be collected.

---

## Validation Pipeline

This pipeline handle the evaluation of the Vortex model (Pytorch state dict `.pth`) in term of model's performance and resource usage. In addition, this pipeline also generate a visual report. If you need to integrate the validation into your own script you can see the [validation pipeline API section](../api/vortex.core.pipelines.md#pytorchvalidationpipeline).

To run this pipeline, make sure you've already prepared :

- **Validation dataset** : see [this section](../modules/builtin_dataset.md) for built-in datasets, or [this section](dataset_integration.md) for external datasets
- **Experiment file** : see [this section](experiment_file_config.md) to create one. Must be valid for validation, make sure [`dataset.eval`](experiment_file_config.md#dataset) and [`validator`](experiment_file_config.md#trainer) is set
- **Vortex model's file** `*.pth` : obtained from [training pipeline](#training-pipeline) which corresponds to the previous mentioned experiment file

The **minimum configuration** required in the experiment file to run training pipeline:
- `experiment_name`
- `model`
- `trainer`
- `device`
- `dataset`
- `dataloader`
- `validator`

You only need to run this command from the command line interface :

```console
usage: vortex validate [-h] -c CONFIG [-w WEIGHTS] [-v] [--quiet]
                       [-d [DEVICES [DEVICES ...]]] [-b BATCH_SIZE]

Vortex Pytorch model validation pipeline; successful runs will produce
autogenerated reports

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        path to experiment config
  -w WEIGHTS, --weights WEIGHTS
                        path to selected weights(optional, will be inferred
                        from `output_directory` and `experiment_name` field
                        from config) if not specified
  -v, --verbose         verbose prediction output
  --quiet
  -d [DEVICES [DEVICES ...]], --devices [DEVICES [DEVICES ...]]
                        computation device to be used for prediction, possible
                        to list multiple devices
  -b BATCH_SIZE, --batch-size BATCH_SIZE
                        batch size for validation
```

**NOTES** : if `--weights` is not provided, Vortex will assume final weights exist in the **experiment directory**


E.g. :

```console
vortex validate -c experiments/config/efficientnet_b0_classification_cifar10.yml \
                -b 8 \
                -d cpu cuda
```

This pipeline will generate several outputs :

- **Report file** : after successful evaluation, report file will be generated under directory `reports` in the **experiment directory** based on `experiment_name` under `output_directory`. Pro Tip : the generated report could be easily converted to pdf using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/demos.html) or [vscode markdown-pdf extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf).

## Hyperparameters Optimization Pipeline

This pipeline is used to search for optimum hyperparameter to be used for either training pipeline or validation pipeline (parameter in validation pipeline also can be used for prediction pipeline). Basically this pipeline is [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) wrapper for Vortex components. If you need to integrate the prediction into your own script you can see the [hyperparameters optimization pipeline API section](../api/vortex.core.pipelines.md#hypoptpipeline).

To run this pipeline, make sure you've already prepared :

- **Hypopt config file** : see [this section](hypopt_file_config.md) to create one
- **Experiment file** : see [this section](experiment_file_config.md) to create one
- **Vortex model's file** `*.pth` : obtained from [training pipeline](#training-pipeline) which corresponds to the previous mentioned experiment file
- Related objective's pipeline requirement

You only need to run this command from the command line interface :

```console

                        path to selected weights (optional, will be inferred
                        from `output_directory` and `experiment_name` field
                        from config) if not specified, valid only for
                        ValidationObjective, ignored otherwise
```

**NOTES** : if `--weights` is not provided, Vortex will assume final weights exist in the **experiment directory**

E.g. :

```console
vortex hypopt -c experiments/config/efficientnet_b0_classification_cifar10.yml \
              -o experiments/hypopt/learning_rate_search.yml
```

This pipeline will generate several outputs :

- **Hypopt Output Dir** : `hypopt/{hypopt_study_name}` will be created under **experiment directory**
- **Best Parameters** : file `*.txt` containing best parameters will be created in **hypopt output dir**

## Graph Export Pipeline

This pipeline is used to export trained Vortex model (or graph) into another graph representation (or Intermediate Representation (IR)). If you need to integrate the graph export pipeline into your own script you can see the [graph export pipeline API section](../api/vortex.core.pipelines.md#graphexportpipeline).

To run this pipeline, make sure you've already prepared :

- **Experiment file** : see [this section](experiment_file_config.md) to create one and make sure the `exporter` section is already configured
- **Vortex model's file** `*.pth` : obtained from [training pipeline](#training-pipeline) which corresponds to the previous mentioned experiment file
- **Example Input Image** : example input image for correct graph tracing. Recommended for using image from training dataset and strongly recommended for model with detection task

You only need to run this command from the command line interface :

```console
usage: vortex export [-h] -c CONFIG [-w WEIGHTS] [-i EXAMPLE_INPUT]

export model to specific IR specified in config, output IR are stored in the
experiment directory based on `experiment_name` under `output_directory`
config field, after successful export, you should be able to visualize the
network using [netron](https://lutzroeder.github.io/netron/)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG

                        path to selected weights (optional, will be inferred
                        from `output_directory` and `experiment_name` field
                        from config) if not specified
  -i EXAMPLE_INPUT, --example-input EXAMPLE_INPUT
                        path to example input for tracing (optional, may be
                        necessary for correct tracing, especially for
                        detection model)
```

**NOTES** : if `--weights` is not provided, Vortex will assume final weights exist in the **experiment directory**

E.g. :

```console
vortex export -c experiments/config/efficientnet_b0_classification_cifar10.yml -i image1.jpg
```

This pipeline will generate several outputs :

- **IR model file** : IR model file will be created under **experiment directory**, with file extension that correspond to [`exporter`](../modules/exporter.md) settings
